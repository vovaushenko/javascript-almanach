var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher() {
	// ..
};
// We know askQuestion ends up in the outer scope. But what about the ofTheTeacher identifier? For formal function declarations, the name identifier ends up in the outer/enclosing scope, so it may be reasonable to assume that's the case here. But ofTheTeacher is declared as an identifier inside the function itself:
askQuestion();
// function ofTheTeacher()...

console.log(ofTheTeacher);
// ReferenceError: ofTheTeacher is not defined
