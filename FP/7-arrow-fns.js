// Functions Without function

/*
That’s right; => arrow functions are lexically anonymous; there’s no way to syntacti-
cally provide it a name. Their names can be inferred like regular functions, but again,
the most common case of function expression values passed as arguments won’t get
any assistance in that way. Bummer.
*/

//! Honestly, the anonymity of => arrow functions is a => dagger to the heart, for
//! me. I cannot abide by the loss of naming. It’s harder to read, harder to debug, and
//! impossible to self-reference.
