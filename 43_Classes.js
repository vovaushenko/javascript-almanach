// What is a class?

// ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢In JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }
}

console.log(typeof User); // function

// What class User {...} construct really does is:

// Creates a function named User, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the constructor method (assumed empty if we donâ€™t write such method).
// Stores class methods, such as sayHi, in User.prototype.

// After new User object is created, when we call its method, itâ€™s taken from the prototype, just as described in the chapter F.prototype. So the object has access to class methods.

// class is a function
console.log(typeof User); // function

// ...or, more precisely, the constructor method
console.log(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true

// The methods are in User.prototype, e.g:
console.log(User.prototype.sayHi); // the code of the sayHi method

// there are exactly two methods in the prototype
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi
