## Symbol

Symbol is a new type
Symbol is a reference, like an object
Symbol is a pointer, of size that correlates with the architecture either 32bit or 64bit
We use symbols like objects - references or pointers
But we will use the as keys for objecs, maps, sets, bigmaps, bigsets

This is useful -> we can put long string 5000 chars (which is more then 32 or 64 bit) in an object. But the refereence in the obj is still 32/64 bit

## Main use of symbols!

To avoid name collisions
